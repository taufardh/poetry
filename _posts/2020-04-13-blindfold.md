I can see the future,  
whether true or not,  

but I can't do anything,  
humans have a way of looking,  
and cannot be understood,  
and cannot be written down,  
can only be understood by the soul.  
by instincts,  
by calmness,  
by insight,  
and by many points of view,  
basically, humans are selfish creatures,  
my eyes can see the border between life and death,  
but covered by blindfolds,  
and stay silent in the silence,  
then shut up you filthy human...
